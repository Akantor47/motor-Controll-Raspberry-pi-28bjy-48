# motor-Controll-Raspberry-pi-28bjy-48
Controll a 28bjy-48 Motor with driver with the raspberry pi GPIO Pins 

define.sh should be changed to the correct pins.

For your safety "define.sh" should start automaticly with the Raspberry Pi.

To execute a movement just run the script with a number for input 1.
Like "./up.sh 5"
The number gives the count of stepps (times 8) the motor makes.

Less than 8 stepps is not possibly at the moment with this scripts.

I may not assume any liability if something bad happens. Be safe and sure about everything you do.
